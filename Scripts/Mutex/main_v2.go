/*
  - Create a Global Maps
  - Run Two functions : Reader, Writer : there will be issue of dirty read-write functions.
  - Mutex : helps to lock the shared resources.
    a.RwMutex : Multiple readers can reads the data but anyone can access.

Error Handling Major Design Pattern:
1. Return in the functions as the last value.
2. Handling error if error != nil then do the stuff.
3. Wrapping Error : need to some additional information, then will be pull the first place we have added here.
